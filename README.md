OVERVIEW:



PROJECT: Caesar Cipher - Python Encryption & Decryption Tool

This is a simple Python-based Caesar Cipher tool that allows users to encrypt and decrypt messages using a specified shift/key value.

 ---
 
Overview:


The Caesar Cipher is one of the most basic and widely known encryption techniques. It works by shifting each letter of the input message by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet. This tool provides:

Encryption: Convert plain text to encrypted text.

Decryption: Revert encrypted text back to readable plain text using the same shift value.

Easy user input for message and shift key.

Supports both uppercase and lowercase letters.

Ignores and preserves non-alphabetic characters (e.g.: numbers, punctuation, spaces).
